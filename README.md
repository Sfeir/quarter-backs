# Quarters Back

> ### Welcome to landing page of the new SFEIR back meet-ups.

The idea behind those meet-ups is to keep up to date with state of the art about all technologies evolving around so 
called **the back-end** in the software development industry.

All Languages, architectures and languages are welcome.

The 'Quarters Back' meet-ups are open for all with respect of the following :

- make a proposal by adding an [new issue](https://github.com/Sfeir/quarters-back/issues/new) on the current repository
- Talks must not exceed **20' (experimental)** 
- All technologies, architectures ...etc are welcome
- Demos are welcome
- Come as you are, talk about what ever you want the you way you want.

>
> **SFEIR** will offer :pizza: and :tropical_drink: and all events will be held in SFEIR head quarters and start generally at :hourglass: 19h00
